🎵 Simple Harmonic Motion using Python

This project demonstrates Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) using Python.
It calculates and visualizes the displacement of a particle performing SHM as a function of time using NumPy and Matplotlib.


🚀 Features

✅ Calculates displacement for a given amplitude, angular frequency, and phase.
✅ Plots a clean and professional displacement vs. time graph.
✅ Automatically saves the plot as shm.png.
✅ Easy to run in Spyder, VS Code, or the terminal.

🧩 Files Included
File Name	Description
shm.py	Main Python script for plotting SHM
shm.png	Output graph (auto-generated after running the code)


▶️ How to Run in Spyder (Anaconda)

Open Spyder (from Anaconda Navigator or by typing spyder in the terminal).

Create a new Python file and name it shm.py.

Copy and paste the provided Python code into the editor.

Save the file (Ctrl + S).

Make sure NumPy and Matplotlib are installed (see above).

Click Run ▶

The graph will appear in the Plots pane (right side) and also be saved as shm.png in your working directory.

📊 Output Preview

The program produces a cosine wave representing SHM displacement over time:

⚙️ Example Parameters
